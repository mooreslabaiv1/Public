### Architecture Specification Document

#### Overview
A priority encoder is a sequential circuit that, when given an input bit vector, outputs the position of the first `1` bit in the vector. For example, a 4-bit priority encoder given the input `4'b1001` would output `2'd0`, because bit[0] is the first bit that is high when the priority is evaluated from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

If none of the input bits are high (i.e., the input is zero), the output should be zero (`2'd0`). The module should also include a **clock** (`clk`) and an **asynchronous reset** (`reset`) signal. The final output must be stored in a flip-flop to ensure sequential behavior.

#### Key Features
1. **Inputs:**
   - `in`: A 4-bit vector representing the input to the priority encoder.
   - `clk`: The clock signal to synchronize the output with the clock domain.
   - `reset`: An asynchronous reset signal to reset the output to `2'd0`.

2. **Outputs:**
   - `pos`: A 2-bit vector representing the position of the first `1` bit in the input vector, stored in a flip-flop.

3. **Behavior:**
   - The priority encoder evaluates the position of the first `1` bit in the `in` vector, starting from the least significant bit (`in[0]`) and moving to the most significant bit (`in[3]`).
   - The computed position is stored in a flip-flop and updated on the next rising edge of the clock.
   - If `reset` is asserted, the output `pos` is immediately set to `2'd0`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `in` is `4'b0000`, the output `pos` is set to `2'd0`.
   - If multiple bits are set in the input (e.g., `4'b1100`), the position of the least significant `1` bit (highest priority) is selected.

#### Module Declaration
The module has the following declaration:
```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module (
    input [3:0] in,
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [1:0] pos
);
```

#### Implementation Overview
1. **Combinational Logic for Priority Encoding:**
   - A combinational block is used to evaluate the input vector `in` and determine the position of the first `1` bit.

2. **Sequential Logic:**
   - The computed position is stored in a flip-flop.
   - On the rising edge of the clock, the output `pos` is updated with the new value.

3. **Asynchronous Reset:**
   - The reset signal ensures that the output `pos` is set to `2'd0` regardless of the input vector.
